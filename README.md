CHIP-8
======

This is a CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust.

WARNING: STILL WIP!

## What is CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 is a language, developed in the 1970's to be used on the
RCA COSMAC VIP computer. More information about it are linked below.

## Why CHIP-8?

I know, many CHIP-8 interpreters already exist, but I liked the concept
behind the language. Also, I'm relatively new to Rust so this is my first
own project and it serves as a good practice.

If you came here, thinking about giving your own try at it, I can highly
recommend it as it was a very fun and interesting progress learning
all the **bits** and pieces about this language.

## Dependencies

This project requires [Rust-SDL2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2).
Their repo also features a tutorial for installing it in your specific
operating system.

## References

These are the referenced I used to understand CHIP-8 and write
the emulator.

## Credits

I really should mention [this](https://github.com/starrhorne/chip8-rust)
github repo, as it got me into this whole CHIP-8 thing.

I also should point out that I only used it as a reference and didn't
copy any of StarrHorne's code.
